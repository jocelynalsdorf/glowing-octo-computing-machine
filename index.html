<span>DESCRIPTION</span>

<p>Tile is one of the most successful crowd-funded hardware campaigns in history and is building the world’s largest collaborative search party to help people never lose anything again. We are just as focused on building a helpful community as we are about building an incredible product. We’re looking for more superstars to join our fast growing and venture backed team. Did we just find you?</p>

<span>Overview</span>

<p>Here at Tile, we are looking for good-hearted, incredibly empathetic, and helpful individuals to build out our customer-centric support & community organization. As a member of Tile’s fast growing Customer Service Team, you will be responsible for delighting our customers when they need our support.</p>

<p>People love their Tile, but like any startup, we have our host of technical challenges and bugs. You understand that people need help, and find delight in teaching them “how to fish” or just simply solving their problems. You actually enjoy it when products break because it gives you an opportunity to delight a customer, build a relationship, and solve their problem quickly. If this sounds like you, we'd love to meet you!</p>

<span>Responsibilities</span>

		<li>Learn and understand how Tile works inside and out.</li>
		<li>Give customers the TLC they need (over email and chat) so they can keep on Tiling</li>

		<li>Works closely with Customer Support and Engineering teams to improve troubleshooting guidelines</li>
